I’m **Sairaj** — a red team enthusiast passionate about ethical hacking and real-world penetration testing.

I spend my time solving labs, diving into AD environments, and constantly sharpening my offensive security skills through platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**.

I’m actively involved with **ISKCON**, which deeply enriches my life — helping me stay grounded, cultivate discipline, and maintain spiritual clarity as I navigate the fast-paced world of cybersecurity.
